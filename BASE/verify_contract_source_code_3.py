# 1. Liquidity and Contract Data:
# Low Liquidity: If a coin has very low liquidity, it might be a scam. Check the liquidity pool on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and look for unusually low liquidity.
# Contract Verification: Verify if the contract is verified on the blockchain explorer. Unverified contracts can be a red flag.

def check_liquidity(token_address): # Example function to check liquidity
    dexscreener_api_endpoint = f'https://api.dexscreener.com/latest/dex/tokens/{token_address}'

# 2. Transaction Patterns:
# High Buy-to-Sell Ratio: If the majority of transactions are buys with very few sells, it might be a sign of a honeypot. Scammers often make it easy for users to buy but hard to sell.
# Recent Transactions: Analyze recent transactions for large, suspicious activity, such as multiple large buys or sells from a single address.

# 3. Contract Features:
# Check for Blacklist or Whitelist Mechanisms: Some contracts have mechanisms that prevent certain addresses from selling. Look for functions that could restrict transfers or implement anti-bot measures.
# Fee Structures: Contracts that have extremely high fees on transactions or transfers could be a sign of a scam.

# 4. Smart Contract Code Review:
# Automated Tools: Use automated tools and services to analyze the contract code for common scam patterns. Tools like Myco or ContractChecker can help.

# Distribution of wallets (is it a burn wallet?)

# Locked Liquidity: Ensure liquidity is locked; if not, developers might withdraw it, crashing the token's value.
